## What is it?

<mark>Plexus is a toolkit for orchestrating data in scalable reactive applications</mark>. In other words, we make state management, api
communication, event management, & data manipulation significantly easier. The word "plexus" is defined as <i>
	"a network of nerves or vessels in the body"
</i>. The name is a metaphor for how plexus works. The tools in this package span the entire project and each one is interconnected behind the scenes like
nerves in the body!

Unlike nerves though, plexus can be inserted incrementally and over time. It also scales with your application and incredibly performant.

## Motivation

We designed Plexus to be highly modular, unopinionated, and flexible, providing not only the tools needed to create scalable applications, but the flexibility to build it however you want.

## Should you addopt Plexus?

Absolutely! You can <em>easily incrementally adopt</em> it into to your project <strong>no matter the stage or size</strong>.

## Use Cases

Here are a couple of use cases to get you started. Your app can utilize some of these, or all of these. Totally up to you. And this is all treeshakable so production builds only use what's needed.

---

### SSOT

Here is a simple example of a small utilization of Plexus in a react application. We are creating a core instance (which is a fancy way of saying an object) of our data. We can then export that core and use it and edit it in out components. Every component that uses thes value will be reactive to edits across the DOM.

```ts title="/core/index.ts"
import { state, collection } from "@plexusjs/core"
export const core = {
	tasks: {
		collection: collection().createGroups(["completed", "incomplete"]),
	},
	user: {
		name: state("default_username"),
	},
}

export default core
```

Above, we are creating a small <strong>core</strong> where everything Plexus related is defined in a single file. üò∞ While you can <em>technically</em> orchestrate your data this way, it's <em>probably</em> not the best idea. Things will get very messy as the number of data points grows.

If you would like to see the core templates we came up with to keep your data structure scalable, check out our [Style Guides Page](/docs/style-guides). We recommend chosing a [Style](/docs/style-guides) that best fit's the application.

```tsx live title="/pages/index.tsx"
import { state } from "@plexusjs/core"
import { usePlexus } from "@plexusjs/react"
import core from "/core"

export default function Home() {
	const completedTasks = usePlexus(core.tasks.collection.groups.complete)
	return (
		<div>
			{completedTasks.map((v) => (
				<div>{v.name}</div>
			))}
		</div>
	)
}
```

	sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
/>
</div>

### API Requests

Here is an example of a user creating Plexus API Instances to communicate with a server.

```tsx live title="/pages/index.tsx"
import { api } from "@plexusjs/core"
// this baseURL should lead to a path on your server. So We can point at `api/v1` for example.
const apiv1 = api("/api/v1")
interface User {
	name: string
	age: number
}
export default function Home() {
	const getUsers = async () => {
		// Here you chose a method to call the API, also providing a path and a payload (if needed).
		const response = await apiv1.get<User[]>("/users")

		if (response.ok) {
			// response.data will be of type User[]
			console.log(response.data)
		}
	}
	return (
		<div>
			{data.map((v) => (
				<button onClick={() => getUsers()}>Call Api</button>
			))}
		</div>
	)
}
```

### Event Management

You can create and patch over custom events using the `event()` from PlexusJS

```ts title="/core/index.ts"
import { event } from "@plexusjs/core"
type FilterData = {
	filters?: {
		size?: "small" | "medium" | "large"
	}
}
export const core = {
	search: {
		filtering: event<FilterData>(),
	},
}

export default core
```

### Data Orchestration

When you edit a [Stateful](/docs/getting-started/concepts#internal-terms) value, it will update everything that is watching it.

### Data Persistence

You can easily persist your data to a user's browser Session Storage and <em>soon any other long term storage.</em>

```ts title="/core/index.ts"
import { state } from "@plexusjs/core"
export const core = {
	user: {
		name: state("default_username").persist("username"),
	},
}

export default core
```
