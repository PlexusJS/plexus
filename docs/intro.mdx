## What is it?

Plexus is a SSOT toolkit for building out scalable reactive applications. In other words, we make state management, api communication, event management, & data manipulation a breeze. According to a dictionary somewhere, "plexus" is defined as <i>"a network of nerves or vessels in the body"</i>. The name is a metaphor for how plexus works. The tools in this package span the entire project and each one is interconnected like nerves in the body!

## Motivation

Most state libraries come along with complex syntax, confusing terminology and lack functionality out of the box. Plexus gets straight to the point, providing not only the tools needed to create scalable applications, but the flexibility to build in many different ways.

## Why use Plexus instead of...

### ...Redux?

Redux has a very Restricted & opinionated design/structure. You do it the Redux way, or no way. It can be tricky to set up; you need to configure both the store and the actions before you can use Redux in your app. Redux is also very difficult to debug. It's not always necessary; if you're just building a simple app, you might not need the extra complexity that Redux adds.

### ...VueX?

VueX can make your code more difficult to read and debug, since it introduces a lot of new concepts and can be confusing at first. Additionally, VueX can make your application more complex and difficult to maintain, since it adds a lot of new code to your project. Finally, VueX can impact the performance of your application, since it adds a lot of overhead.

### ...RxJs?

RxJS is a large and complex library, which can make it difficult to learn and use. Second, RxJS is not always compatible with other libraries and frameworks, which can limit its usefulness in some cases. Finally, some developers have found that RxJS can be challenging to debug, which can be a major downside if you're working on a large or complex project.

### ...MobX?

There are a few potential cons of using MobX, including the possibility of messy code if not used correctly, and the potential for performance issues if state is not handled optimally. However, overall, MobX can be a very helpful tool for managing state in JavaScript applications.

### ...Context API?

It can create unnecessary complexity in your code if not used carefully. The Context API is still fairly new and may change in future versions of React, which could break your code.
