## What is it?

<mark>Plexus is a toolkit for orchestrating data in scalable reactive applications</mark>. In other words, we make state management, api
communication, event management, & data manipulation significantly easier. The word "<mark>plexus</mark>" is defined as <i>
	"a network of nerves or vessels in the body"
</i>. The name is a metaphor for how plexus works. The tools in this package span the entire project and each one is interconnected behind the scenes like
nerves in the body!

Unlike nerves though, plexus can be inserted incrementally and over time. It also scales with your application and incredibly performant.

## Motivation

We designed Plexus to be highly modular, unopinionated, and flexible, providing not only the tools needed to create scalable applications, but the flexibility to build it however you want.

## Should you addopt Plexus?

Absolutely! You can <em>easily incrementally adopt</em> it into to your project <strong>no matter the stage or size</strong>.
Here are a couple of use cases to get you started. Your app can utilize some of these, or all of these. Totally up to you. And this is all treeshakable so production builds only use what's needed.

## Use Cases

---

#### SSOT

<MenuOption
	left={
		<div>
			Plexus can be used to manage and <mark>orchestrate global state</mark> in your application. This is a great way to manage data that is
			shared across the entire application.
		</div>
	}

#### Data Persistence

<MenuOption
	left={
		<div>
			You can <mark>easily persist your data</mark> to a user's browser Session Storage and <i>soon any other long term storage</i>.
