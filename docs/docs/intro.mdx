## What is it?

<mark>
	Plexus is a toolkit for orchestrating data in scalable reactive applications
</mark>
. In other words, we make state management, api communication, event management,
& data manipulation significantly easier. The word "<mark>plexus</mark>" is defined
as <i>"a network of nerves or vessels in the body"</i>. The name is a metaphor
for how plexus works. The tools in this package span the entire project and each
one is intelligently interconnected behind the scenes like nerves in the body!

Plexus can be adopted incrementally, over time, scales with your application, and incredibly performant.

## Motivation

We designed Plexus to be highly modular, unopinionated, and flexible, providing not only the tools needed to create scalable applications, but the flexibility to build it however you want. No ContextAPI needed to ensure all of the components using your data are in sync.

## Should you addopt Plexus?

Absolutely! You can <em>easily incrementally adopt</em> it into to your project <strong>no matter the stage or size</strong>.

Here are a couple of use cases to get you started. Your app can utilize some of these, or all of these. Totally up to you. And it's all treeshakable so production builds only use what's needed.

## Use Cases

---

#### SSOT

<MenuOption
	left={
		<div>
			Plexus can be used to manage and <mark>orchestrate global state</mark> in
			your application. This is a great way to manage data that is shared across
			the entire application.
		</div>
	}

	linkText='Read More'
/>

#### Data Orchestration

<MenuOption
	left={
		<div>
			When you edit a{' '}
			<a className='' href='/docs/getting-started/concepts#internal-terms'>
				Stateful value
			</a>
			, it will <mark>update everything that is watching</mark> it.
		</div>
	}
	href='/docs/use-cases/data-orchestration'
	linkText='Read More'
/>

#### Data Persistence

<MenuOption
	left={
		<div>
			You can <mark>easily persist data</mark> to a user's browser Session
			Storage and <i>soon any other long term storage</i>.
		</div>
	}
	href='/docs/use-cases/data-persistence'
	linkText='Read More'
/>

#### API Requests

<MenuOption
	left={
		<div>
			You can use Plexus's powerful yet simple <mark>built in http client</mark>{' '}
			using the <code>api()</code> Instance!
		</div>
	}
	href='/docs/use-cases/api-requests'
	linkText='Read More'
/>

#### Event Engines

<MenuOption
	left={
		<div>
			You can emit and recieve over custom events using the <code>event()</code>{' '}
			Instance from PlexusJS. This is connected to the Plexus Network for some
			cool superpowers!
		</div>
	}
	href='/docs/use-cases/events'
