## Quick Setup

<small>With Yarn</small>

```bash prefix="$"
yarn create plexus-core --typescript
```

<small>With NPX</small>

```bash
npx create-plexus-core --typescript
```

## Ideology

The focus of this style is to be simple and clean. Very little boilerplate but still well organized. This style works best for:

<ul className="list">
	<li>Sub-sites and basic dashboards</li>
	<li>Weekend side-projects</li>
	<li>School projects</li>
</ul>

## File Structure Suggestion

```sh
/project-root
├─ core/
│ ├─ actions.ts
│ ├─ states.ts
└ ├─ api.ts
  └─ types.ts
```

## File Content Examples

### `/core/types.ts`

We can create our types and interfaces in this file and export it for the rest of our core (or the rest of our app if we want).

```ts title="/core/types.ts"
export interface ChannelData {
	uuid: string
	name: string
	followers: number
}
```

### `/core/states.ts`

This is where we define [stateful instances](/docs/getting-started/concepts#internal-terms) things like states, computed, and collections.

```ts title="/core/states.ts"
import { state, collection, computed } from "@plexusjs/core"

// Importing the ChannelData type
import { ChannelData } from "/types"

// Create a state instance
export const userData = state({
	name: "",
	age: -1,
})

// This collection is used to store the channels, the objects should be of type ChannelData defined above
export const channelsCollection = collection<ChannelData>({
	primaryKey: "uuid", // default value is "id"
})
```

### `/core/api.ts`

This is where we can create our API [instances](/docs/getting-started/concepts#internal-terms). we can interract with this elsewhere to interract with data from the server.

```ts title="/core/api.ts"
import { api } from "@plexusjs/core"

// You can use the api to make requests to the server at a specific endpoint
export const channelBroker = api("https://api.example.com/channels").auth("MyCoolAuthToken", "bearer")
```

### `/core/actions.ts`

Here is where we define our <i>actions</i>. An <i>action</i> is a function that is called to preform business logic. Technically, an <i>action</i> is just a buffed up function, so you can just use it as a function wrapper to gain the benifits of the <i>action hooks</i>.

```ts title="/core/actions.ts"
import { action } from "@plexusjs/core"

// Import your module instances
import { channelsCollection } from "./states"
import { channelBroker } from "./api"

// This action is used to fetch the channels from the API
export const subscribeToChannel = action(async ({ onCatch }) => {
	onCatch(console.error)
	const { data } = await channelBroker.get("/get-channels")

	channelsCollection.collect(data)
})
```

### `/core/index.ts`

Here is the final file we make; the index file takes all of your [instances](/docs/getting-started/concepts#internal-terms) from the other files and exports them into single point.

```ts title="/core/index.ts"
// Import your module instances
import * as actions from "./actions"
import * as states from "./states"
import * as api from "./api"

// Export your module instances from a single index.ts file
export { actions, states, api }
```
