Hey guys! Sorry it took so long, but <mark><strong>the stable first version of Plexus is live!</strong></mark> This is the groundwork for a ton of future ideas we have for this project.

If you came here from pulse, Plexus has a very similar syntax to pulse 4 so it should be _mostly_ a plug and play replacement. Plexus also has a ton of flexibility, but with that comes complexity (under the hood). We wanted to make plexus as easy as possible to use and have most of the hoisting and management magic happen behind the scenes. But we also wanted plexus to be as extendable as possible. Having both is not easy, but Iâ€™m happy to say: **I think** we accomplished this goal!

Now comes the real challenge... people like you using it in the wild. As you <mark>build amazing things with it</mark>, let us know what you think & hopefully we didn't miss too many edge cases.

So you're probably wondering: Where the hell are the docs?
My answer to that is...
uhhh...
It's coming asap lol
Rems and I are still working on it, so no official docs site just yet; although, I made sure the actual functions/methods have jsdocs that are somewhat detailed (obviously this is open to criticism & feedback as well). For now, they should be descriptive enough to get you moving.

Thank you all so much for your interest in Plexus! Letâ€™s build an awesome library, together! ðŸ˜Š
