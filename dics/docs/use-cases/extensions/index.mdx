# Extending Plexus

Plexus is extremly flexible. you can add functionality to the library by using our helper functions. But before you can start building out extensions, we need to go over how plexus works under the hood.

## How Plexus Works

I'm going to let GPT-3 write this out for me lol:

<strong>Question</strong>:

```txt
Describe how the reactive state orchestration NodeJS module called "PlexusJS" works:
```

<strong>Answer</strong>:{" "}

```txt
"PlexusJS" is a NodeJS module that helps manage state in applications. It uses an event-based system to keep track of
changes to application state and propagate those changes to the rest of the application. This allows for more flexibility and modularity in
applications, as well as better performance.
```

Hey! That's actually kinda right! But the way we connect everything is the important part here.

## How to Extend Plexus

Extending plexus is easy, and there are a few ways to do it.

## Where we plan to go

I'm going to let GPT-3 write this out for me lol:

<strong>Question</strong>:

```txt
Describe how the state orchestration reactive NodeJS module called "PlexusJS" works:
```

<strong>Answer</strong>:{" "}

```txt
The state orchestration reactive NodeJS module called PlexusJS consists of three main parts: the Plexus server, the
NodeJS client, and the ReactJS frontend. The Plexus server is responsible for managing the state of the application and the NodeJS client is
responsible for connecting to the Plexus server and sending commands to it. The ReactJS frontend is responsible for displaying the state of the
application to the user and for responding to user input.
