# Plexus v2 Guidelines

## Introduction

Plexus was originally created as a way to provide a common set of tools and stateful SSOT that was really useful for SPA development. With the recent pivot of major frameworks like (mainly) nextjs, we need to pivot our approach. The goal is to make everything event based (nothing is stored in a centralized memory point, instead propegated to other siblings using ) and api driven.
